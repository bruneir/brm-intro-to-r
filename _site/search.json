    "text": "1. Introduction to R & RStudio\nWhen people consider switching to R, they usually think about it as a direct replacement for whatever tool they’re currently using. While R can indeed replace software like Excel, SPSS, or Stata, it offers much more!\nSuppose a current workflow that looks like this,\n\nData analysis in SPSS (or a similar tool)\nData visualization in Excel\nReport writing in Word\n\nHave you ever encountered an error in the first step and had to go back through all three steps to fix it? It’s quite frustrating, isn’t it?\nR can get around this by combining data analysis, visualization, and reporting in one tool using RMarkdown. Any time you realize you’ve made a mistake, you just rerun your code and you get a new report. Think of the time it can save you!\nHence, R is a popular programming language, especially in certain fields such as data science, academic research, and statistics.\nRStudio is an integrated development editor (IDE) for R. It is easier to write code using the editor.\nHere are several reasons why you should use R:\n\nR is widely used among statisticians, especially academic statisticians.\n\nIf there is a new statistical procedure developed somewhere in academia, chances are that the code for it will be made available in R. This distinguishes R from, say, Python.\n\nR is commonly used for statistical analyses in many disciplines.\n\nOther software, such as SPSS or SAS is also used and in some disciplines would be the primary choice for some discipline specific courses, but R is popular and its user base is growing.\n\nR is free.\n\nYou can install it and all optional packages on your computer at no cost. This is a big difference between R and SAS, SPSS, MATLAB, and most other statistical software.\n\nR is has a vibrant and growing community.\n\nWith the advent of the tidyverse and RStudio, R is a vibrant and growing community. We also have found the community to be extremely welcoming. The R ecosystem is one of its strengths.\n\n\nIn this workshop, we will dive into the fundamentals of R and RStudio."

Getting Started with R & RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’ll learn\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the R Language.\nInstalling the RStudio.\nExploring the RStudio Interface\nPackages & help() function\n\n\n\nFollow the guidelines in Brunei R website - Under blog, “How to Install R and Rstudio”\nOnce installed, launch RStudio and this is probably what you’ll see.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the default panes:\n\nConsole (entire left)\nEnvironment/History (tabbed in upper right)\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nEverything which is done in R is done by functions. Commonly used functions are grouped in packages. Installing different packages expand the functionality of R.\nPackages are bundles of code that add new functions to R.\n\nBase packages are installed with R but not loaded by default.\nContributed packages need to be downloaded, installed & loaded separately.\n\nTo install a package, say tidyverse, for the first time, type\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo load the package, type the package name without quotation\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nRecommended Packages\nFor data manipulation:\n\ntidyverse - An opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This collection includes all the packages in this section, plus many more for data import, tidying, and visualization listed here.\n\nFor data visualization:\n\nggplot2 - R’s famous package for making beautiful graphics. ggplot2 lets you use the grammar of graphics to build layered, customizable plots.\n\nFor reproducible reporting:\n\nR Markdown - The perfect workflow for reproducible reporting. Write R code in your markdown reports. When you run render, R Markdown will replace the code with its results and then export your report as an HTML, pdf, or MS Word document, or a HTML or pdf slideshow. The result? Automated reporting. R Markdown is integrated straight into RStudio.\n\nand many more…\n\n\nGetting help\nTo access R’s built-in help facility to get information on any function simply use the help() function. For example, to open the help page for our friend the mean() function.\n\nhelp(\"mean\")\n\nor you can use the equivalent shortcut.\n\n?mean\n\nAfter you run the code, the help page is displayed in the ‘Help’ tab in the Files pane (bottom right of RStudio).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find what package a function belongs to, use the ?? operator.\n\n??survfit\n\nor you can always google it!"

Basics of R Programming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’ll learn\n\n\n\n\nData types in R\nVariables and assignment\nBasic arithmetic operations\nWorking with vectors and basic vector operations\n\n\n\nImportant basics:\n\nR is case sensitive i.e. A is not the same as a and anova is not the same as Anova.\nAnything that follows a # symbol is interpreted as a comment and ignored by R. Comments should be used liberally throughout your code for both your own information and also to help your collaborators\nIn general, R is fairly tolerant of extra spaces inserted into your code, in fact using spaces is actively encouraged. However, spaces should not be inserted into operators i.e. &lt;- should not read &lt; - (note the space).\n\n\nData types\nThere are 6 basic types of data in R; numeric, integer, logical, character, complex and raw. However, in this workshop we will not be covering complex and raw as it is usually not widely used.\n\nLogical\n\nLogical data take on the value of either TRUE or FALSE. There’s also another special type of logical called NA to represent missing values.\n\n\n\nx &lt;- TRUE\nx\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ny &lt;- FALSE\ny\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nz &lt;- NA\nz\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nLogical Operators\nLogical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nOperation\nVectorized?\nElement-wise Logical AND operator.

For example, Low, Medium and High which are denoted as factors where the computer record them as by 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nperf &lt;- c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")\nfactor(perf)\n\n[1] Low    Medium High  \nLevels: High Low Medium\n\n\nHere’s a summary table of some of the logical test and coercion functions available to you.\n\n\n\nType\nLogical test\nCoercing\n\n\n\n\nLogical\nis.logical\nas.logical\n\n\nDouble\nis.numeric\nas.numeric\n\n\nInteger\nis.integer\nas.integer\n\n\nCharacter\nis.character\nas.character\n\n\nFactor\nis.factor\nas.factor\n\n\nComplex\nis.complex\nas.complex\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables and Assignment\nVariables in R are used to store data values.

Data structures in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’ll learn\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to matrices, arrays, data frames and list.\nCreating and manipulating data frames.\nAccessing elements in data structures.\n\n\n\nR offers various data structures for storing and manipulating data. The most commonly used ones are vector, matrices, arrays, data frames and list.\n\nMatrix\n\nMatrix is a two-dimensional array. Alternatively, it is stacking multiple vectors of the same length.\n\n\nTo define a matrix from a vector, the syntax is matrix(vector, nrow, ncol, byrow). byrow is the way we fill the array. It is either TRUE or FALSE.\nSize of matrix is rather complicated since it has two dimensions. There are three basics operations:\n\nlength(): total number of elements\nncol(): total number of columns\nnrow(): total number of rows\n\n\nz &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\nz\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    3    4\n[3,]    5    6\n\nlength(z)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\nncol(z) # check number of columns\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nnrow(z) # check number of rows\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe following code fills the matrix by column.\n\nx &lt;- matrix(1:20, nrow=5, ncol=4, byrow=FALSE)\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    6   11   16\n[2,]    2    7   12   17\n[3,]    3    8   13   18\n[4,]    4    9   14   19\n[5,]    5   10   15   20\n\n\nExtracting elements from matrix is similar to extraction in vector.\n\nx[2,] #the second row\n\n[1]  2  7 12 17\n\n\n\nx[,1] #the first column\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\nx[1,2] #first row, second column\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\nmat &lt;- matrix(c(85, 90, 88, 75, 80, 78, 95, 85, 89), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\ncolnames(mat) &lt;- c(\"Physical\", \"Shooting\", \"Strategy\")\nrownames(mat) &lt;- c(\"Hasbul\", \"Khalid\", \"Fitri\")\n\nmat\n\n       Physical Shooting Strategy\nHasbul       85       90       88\nKhalid       75       80       78\nFitri        95       85       89\n\n\n\nArray\n\nArray behaves like matrix but it is multi-dimensional (more than 2). To define array from vector, the syntax is array(vector/input, c(nrow, ncol, nmatrix))\n\nx&lt;- array(1:12, c(2,3,2))\nx\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    7    9   11\n[2,]    8   10   12\n\n\n\nData frame\n\nData frame is most useful form of data type in R. It behaves like matrix but can contain vectors of different types. That is we can have vectors of characters and numeric together, which is not feasible under matrix or array.\nTo visualize a data frame, one may consider a spreadsheet: Each column is a vector and each spreadsheet is a data frame – it is a collection of columns of cells.\n\n\n\n# RBAF Personnel Data\nrbaf_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Hasbul\", \"Khalid\", \"Fitri\"),\n  rank = c(\"Lieutenant\", \"Sergeant\", \"Captain\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35)\n)\nrbaf_df\n\n    name       rank age\n1 Hasbul Lieutenant  25\n2 Khalid   Sergeant  30\n3  Fitri    Captain  35\n\n\n```\nLet’s add a column for years of service:\n\nrbaf_df$service &lt;- c(2, 10, 5) # adding a new column for years of service\nrbaf_df\n\n    name       rank age service\n1 Hasbul Lieutenant  25       2\n2 Khalid   Sergeant  30      10\n3  Fitri    Captain  35       5\n\n\nThe $ operator is used to extract or subset a specific part of a data object in R.\n\nrbaf_df$name\n\n[1] \"Hasbul\" \"Khalid\" \"Fitri\" \n\n\nRemoving the ‘Rank’ column:\n\nrbaf_df$rank &lt;- NULL\nrbaf_df\n\n    name age service\n1 Hasbul  25       2\n2 Khalid  30      10\n3  Fitri  35       5\n\n\nUse rbind() to add rows, such as:\n\nnew_row &lt;- data.frame(name = \"Hafeezul\", age = 28, service = 1)\nrbaf_df &lt;- rbind(rbaf_df, new_row)\n\nrbaf_df\n\n      name age service\n1   Hasbul  25       2\n2   Khalid  30      10\n3    Fitri  35       5\n4 Hafeezul  28       1\n\n\nRemove rows by sub-setting:\n\nrbaf_df &lt;- rbaf_df[-2, ]  # Removes the second row"

    "text": "7. Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’ll learn\n\n\n\n\nCreating basic plots (scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc.).\n\n\n\nR provides powerful tools for data visualization, allowing you to create various types of plots to explore and present your data. Using the Titanic data set, we can create several common types of plots.\n\nScatter Plots:\n\nScatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two variables. Lets plot the relationship between age and fare in the Titanic data set.\n\nplot(titanic$Age, titanic$Fare, \n     main=\"Age vs. Fare\",\n     xlab=\"Age\", ylab=\"Fare\", pch=19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Plots\n\nBar plots are useful for comparing. We will visualize the count of passengers in each class.\n\nbarplot(table(\n  titanic$Pclass), \n        main=\"Count of Passengers by Class\", \n        xlab=\"Passenger Class\", ylab=\"Count\", col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\nHistograms are useful for visualizing the distribution of a single numeric variable. Lets plot the the distribution of ages in the Titanic data set.\n\nhist(titanic$Age, \n     main=\"Distribution of Ages on the Titanic\", \n     xlab=\"Age\", col=\"green\", breaks=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox Plots - Box plots are useful for visualizing the distribution and identifying outliers. Lets visualize the distribution of fares by passenger class.\n\n\nboxplot(Fare ~ Pclass, data=titanic , \n        main=\"Fares by Passenger Class\", \n        xlab=\"Passenger Class\", ylab=\"Fare\", col=\"orange\")"
